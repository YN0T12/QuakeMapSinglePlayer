# Playtesting

## Playtest 1 Nov 21st 2024

See the first blockout video in [Blockout](blockout.md).

### Layout
For the layout of the map the only big issue was the ending button hunt. There were times where the playtester would just walk right past the buttons. Maybe making them blink or light up or arrange them better into the players view might help. Otherwise I think moving the buttons in more prominent locations could help too. When they first entered the room they didn't even know they were trying to find buttons right away. They missed the one right at the entrance. So I think making the buttons stand out more will help.

Another thing for layout is the buttons were a little tricky to push as you had to jump onto them rather than just running into them so I should probably fix that too. And the boxes in the Storage room were a bit tricky to jump on too.

### Pacing
For the pacing of the map I really need to work on the enemies. You go from fighting one enemy at a time to all of a sudden fighting 5 at once in the Storage room. The enemies hitboxes were too tall to jump over when climbing the boxes and they liked trapping you in corners you couldn't escape from either. I think I'll have to put less enemies in the room and change them out to be a different enemy too. As for which one I don't know yet.

### Production values
The production value for the map was obviously still lacking as the map still utilized placeholder textures and zero lighting. But even so, some of the map was lacking textures entirely too that I need to get done. Most notably were the lab tables which playtesters couldn't tell what they were. But what was there never got in the way of gameplay or direction so as for the placeholder textures nothing got in the way of gameplay.

### Engagement
I think for the most part the level might've been a bit too easy aside from the difficult storage room as discussed in Pacing but I think the map overall was still fun to play and had a good gimmick to it. One glaring issue however was the final boss fight as you were able to easily cheese out the 4 Shambler enemies from the balcony which I never tried in my own playtests. That will be something I need to fix.

### Summary

I think the biggest issues I need to fix now is:
1. The Storage Room and general pacing
2. The 2nd floor button hunt
3. The buttons and crates
4. The missing textures
