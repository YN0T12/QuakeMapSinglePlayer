# Theme Brainstorming Ideas

The theme of the map just like the Multiplayer Map I have recently made will be an abandoned Laboratory. The facility was researching human subjects messing with their DNA but something went wrong and they mutated into monsters. The monsters then killed everyone in the lab. 

The player was a fellow scientist who used to work in this lab and was the only one who survived. He feels responsible for creating these monsters and he sends himself back into the lab to kill all the monsters and avenge his coworkers.

The player will explore the building and kill all the monsters found inside. He will have to make it into unauthorized areas and release some monsters from containment tubes to be able to slay them. I think maybe at the end he will blow up the building and there could be a Metroid-style escape.
