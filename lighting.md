# Lighting and Textures

As you probably know by now this map was an altered version of my Quake Multiplayer Deathmatch map by the same name. That being the case the texturing process was pretty simple as most of it is the same as that map. That being said however there are still a few additions and changes to this version of the map.

The first being that now I learned how to add colored lighting to the map. I didn't go crazy with it however. The main two lights that are colored are the red button lights and the computer's soft blue lights.

The addition of the red light and the flashing button texture really draws in the player's attention that this is something they can and should interact with while also helping the player find the buttons. Which is especially helpful on the second floor when the button hunt mechanic is expanded on.

Aside from that the lighting is pretty much one-for-one with the previous multiplayer version of the map.
