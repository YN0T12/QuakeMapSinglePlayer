Watch the video above to get a look at the first blockout of the map. 

Being that this map is a single-player version of my multiplayer Lab map the first thing I did was copy over the Multiplayer map into a new map file. Then I readded all of the prototype textures. I might regret this when it comes time to adding back all the finished textures again but I found the prototype textures to help the blockout process more as I don't need to focus on details and can just focus on gameplay. 

Then I followed my original sketches and applied them to the first floor. That part went pretty smoothly however, when it came time to do the second floor I was more at a loss. But since I already had the gimmick of the button hunt on the first floor I thought an expanded version of that would make the most sense to do next which really fit in the big expansive second floor. 

The final step was the basement to end the level off. I think the slow descent to the basement followed by the reveal of all the tubes of the hard monsters you just fought really scares the player and makes for a good experience.

Watch the video above to get a look at the second blockout of this map after the results of the first [Playtest](playtesting.md).

A few changes were made to the map after the feedback from the playtest. The first thing I changed was the door on the bottom tube to open up from all sides so the enemy is less likely to be cheesed out.

The second and main change I made was to the storage room. Now instead of the fiends overwhelming you and trapping you in the corner, there are now zombies and bomb blocks to introduce you to the grenade launcher and to ease you into the zombies on the second floor.

And finally, I added fewer buttons on the second floor. It seemed too annoying to find 8 buttons in that wide open space so I toned it down to 6 instead and tried to make them more obvious.
